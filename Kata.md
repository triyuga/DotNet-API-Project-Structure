## Overview
Normally we only need to create new .NET solutions at very early stage of an engagement; and it only needs to be done once.
## Prerequisites
Optional - Use Visual Studio (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/with-visual-studio)

Optional - Use Visual Studio Code (with C# Dev Kit) (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/with-visual-studio-code)

Optional - Use Rider (https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Creating_and_Opening_Projects_and_Solutions.html)

## Getting Started
[Generate user stories](https://dev.azure.com/TelstraPurple-Labs/Coding%20Katas/_wiki/wikis/Katas/144/Introduction?anchor=students-doing-a-kata)
 to track your work on our board.

This kata has no starting code.
* Imagine that we are building a back-office system for an online coffee shop. we need API endpoints for our user to list, add, update and delete coffee products.
* You can use mock coffee product data from this repo: https://fake-coffee-api.vercel.app/
## Steps
This kata has the following user stories
1. **Create a skeleton .NET 9 solution** - As a developer, I want a project created using best practices so that it can support development of the application
1. **Add basic CRUD with API controllers** - As a coffee shop owner, I want to list and update my products using the API so that my menu is up to date for my customers
1. **Add Unit & Integration Tests** - As a developer, I want automated tests for the solution so that the functionality of the API is correct and intent of the code is captured.
1. **Add Logging** - As a system operator or developer, I want structured logging and metrics so that I can monitor performance and diagnose issues.
1. **Add API Documentation with Codegen** - As a developer, I want to describe the API with Open API so that I can generate the client data structures
1. **Add MediatR with global error handler** - As a developer, I want to use Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) so that the system can be more scalable and better code readability.
1. **Add health checks** - As a System Operator, I want to know if the system is healthy so that compensating actions can be taken
